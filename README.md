# Important technical details
To make your experience as it was intended by the developer, make sure to follow these steps:
- Bring in 5 friends! The raid is designed specifically for 6 people. It it impossible to complete with less people and can become buggy if there are more people than 6 you need
- Set _Brightness_ to maximum
- Set _difficulty_ to Normal
- Use _No Bats_ datapack (_included in save by default_)
- DO NOT change any gamerules!
- Avoid reloading datapack during gameplay at all costs

**And, most importantly...**
- Go completely _blind_. The raid was designed in the way for you to uncover its mysteries via trial-and-error. To enjoy Witherhope Necopolis in its entierty, it is highly recommended to avoid any spoilers regarding the raid

If you just want to see your friends suffer...
- Join _spectator_ team via
```
/team join spectator @p
```
You will be automatically put in spectator gamemode. All raid mechanics won't affect you at this point
